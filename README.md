Showcase your skills in this Data Engineering project! In this course you will apply a variety of data engineering skills and techniques you have learned as part of the previous courses in the IBM Data Engineering Professional Certificate.  

You will demonstrate your knowledge of Data Engineering by assuming the role of a Junior Data Engineer who has recently joined an organization and be presented with a real-world use case that requires architecting and implementing a data analytics platform. 

In this Capstone project you will complete numerous hands-on labs. You will create and query data repositories using relational and NoSQL databases such as MySQL and MongoDB. Youâ€™ll also design and populate a data warehouse using PostgreSQL and IBM Db2 and write queries to perform Cube and Rollup operations.  

You will generate reports from the data in the data warehouse and build a dashboard using Cognos Analytics. You will also show your proficiency in Extract, Transform, and Load (ETL) processes by creating data pipelines for moving data from different repositories. You will perform big data analytics using Apache Spark to make predictions with the help of a machine learning model. 

This course is the final course in the IBM Data Engineering Professional Certificate. It is recommended that you complete all the previous courses in this Professional Certificate before starting this course.
